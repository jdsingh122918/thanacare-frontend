### Implementation 1: Centered Minimalist Layout with Subtle Branding

This design shifts away from the split-screen approach to a centered, full-width layout for better mobile responsiveness and focus on the user journey. It emphasizes empathy and accessibility, key for non-profits, by using larger typography, high contrast, and clear hierarchies. The background features a subtle gradient overlay on the empowerment image to avoid overwhelming the form. Shadcn components ensure a clean, modern aesthetic with Tailwind's utility classes for customization.

- **Overall Structure**: Use a full-screen `div` with a background image (the provided empowerment photo) set to cover, with a semi-transparent overlay (e.g., bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900/50 to-transparent) for readability. Center a shadcn `Card` component (with variant="outline" for a soft border) containing the login form. Above the card, place the logo using an `img` tag styled with Tailwind.
- **Header Elements**:
  - Logo centered at the top inside the card header.
  - Two shadcn `Button` components side-by-side: "Explore as Guest" (variant="ghost" for subtlety) and "Login" (variant="default" with blue bg to match branding).

- **Form Section**: Inside the `CardContent`, use shadcn `Form` with `Input` for email and password (with type="password" and eye icon for toggle via shadcn's `Input` addon). Add `Checkbox` for "Remember me" and a `Link` (styled as button variant="link") for "Forgot Password". The submit button is a full-width shadcn `Button` (variant="primary", text "LOGIN" in uppercase for emphasis).

- **Footer/Registration Prompt**: Below the form in `CardFooter`, a simple text with shadcn `Button` variant="link" for "Create an Account" and another for "Explore as Guest", encouraging low-commitment entry points to build trust.

- **UX Improvements for Non-Profits**: This reduces cognitive load by centering elements, improves accessibility (WCAG-compliant contrast ratios via shadcn's defaults), and adds micro-interactions like hover states on buttons for engagement. It's empowering by keeping the inspirational image visible but not distracting, aligning with the organization's mission.

### Implementation 2: Split-Screen with Interactive Elements

Retaining the original split-screen for familiarity but modernizing it with dynamic elements, this version uses shadcn for responsive grids and animations. It incorporates subtle interactivity (e.g., fade-ins) to guide users, fostering a sense of community and action—ideal for non-profits focused on empowerment. The left side amplifies the inspirational message, while the right focuses on seamless authentication.

- **Overall Structure**: Use Tailwind's grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2) for the split. Left column: Background image with overlay text using shadcn `Typography` components (H1 for "Your Roadmap to Empowerment" in bold, white text, and P for the description). Add a shadcn `Badge` or `Tooltip` on "stops" to popover explain interactive features upon hover.

- **Header Elements**: Spanning the top as a fixed navbar with shadcn `NavigationMenu`: Logo on left, "Explore as Guest" and "Login" as menu items (using `Button` variant="outline" for the login trigger).

- **Form Section**: Right column uses a shadcn `Card` (elevated shadow for depth). Inside, `Form` with `Label` and `Input` for fields, including a password reveal icon. Include `Switch` instead of checkbox for "Remember me" for a modern toggle feel. "Forgot Password" as a shadcn `Popover` with a quick reset form. Submit with `Button` variant="default", full-width, with loading spinner support for async login.

- **Footer/Registration Prompt**: At the bottom of the right column, a shadcn `Accordion` that expands to show "Create an Account" form on click, reducing initial clutter. Include a guest link as `Button` variant="secondary".

- **UX Improvements for Non-Profits**: Enhances engagement with interactive tooltips/popovers to educate users on the roadmap concept without leaving the page. Responsive design ensures it works on all devices, promoting inclusivity. The split maintains visual storytelling while shadcn's components add polish, encouraging longer sessions and community involvement.

### Implementation 3: Full-Page Overlay with Social Proof

This bold redesign uses a full-page form overlay on the background image, incorporating social proof elements like testimonials to build trust—crucial for non-profits dealing with sensitive topics like empowerment. Shadcn handles the modular components for easy maintenance and scalability.

- **Overall Structure**: Background image full-screen with dark overlay (bg-black/40). Overlay a centered shadcn `Dialog` or modal-like `Card` (large size) for the form, making it feel like a welcoming gateway.

- **Header Elements**: Inside the card header, logo with a shadcn `DropdownMenu` for "Explore as Guest" and "Login" options, allowing quick switches.

- **Form Section**: Core is shadcn `Tabs` component: One tab for "Login" with standard `Input` fields, checkbox, and links; another for "Register" to seamlessly switch to account creation without page reload. Buttons use variant="outline" for register prompt to differentiate from primary login.

- **Footer/Registration Prompt**: Below tabs, add shadcn `Carousel` with short testimonials (e.g., "This roadmap changed my perspective") to inspire action, ending with "Create an Account or Explore as Guest" as inline links.

- **UX Improvements for Non-Profits**: The overlay focuses attention on conversion while social proof elements humanize the experience, reducing abandonment rates. Shadcn's tabs improve flow for users unsure about logging in vs. registering, and built-in accessibility features (aria labels) ensure broad reach. This design empowers users by providing immediate value through testimonials.
