# Profile Picture Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the admin dashboard profile picture functionality to ensure proper persistence and display in the header.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Picture Persistence

- Profile pictures are now properly persisted in the Redux store
- Added `updateProfilePicture` action to the auth slice
- Profile pictures persist between browser sessions via Redux persist

### 2. Real-time Header Updates

- Profile picture updates in the admin dashboard header immediately after upload
- Header automatically reflects changes without requiring page refresh
- Uses Redux store updates for reactive UI changes

### 3. Session Persistence

- Profile pictures are automatically loaded when the app initializes
- Added `refreshUserProfile` function to the `useAuth` hook
- Ensures profile picture data is always up-to-date

## Technical Implementation

### Redux Store Changes

```typescript
// Added to authSlice.ts
updateProfilePicture: (state: AuthState, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
  if (state.user) {
    state.user.profile_picture_url = action.payload;
  }
};
```

### Component Updates

- `ProfilePictureUpload.tsx`: Now dispatches profile picture updates to Redux store
- `AdminLayout.tsx`: Header automatically reflects store changes
- `useAuth.ts`: Added profile picture refresh functionality

### Data Flow

1. User uploads profile picture via `ProfilePictureUpload` component
2. Component dispatches `updateProfilePicture` action to Redux store
3. Store updates user's `profile_picture_url`
4. Header automatically re-renders with new profile picture
5. Data is persisted to localStorage/sessionStorage via Redux persist

## API Endpoints Used

### Profile Picture Upload

- `POST /api/users/profile/picture/upload` - File upload endpoint
- `PUT /api/users/profile/picture` - URL update endpoint
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Profile data retrieval

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend server (`npm run dev`)
3. Login as admin user
4. Navigate to admin dashboard
5. Upload a profile picture using the Profile Picture tab
6. Verify the profile picture appears in the header immediately
7. Refresh the page to verify persistence
8. Test with different image formats and sizes

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify endpoint accessibility:

```bash
./scripts/test_profile_picture.sh
```

## Browser Console Debugging

The enhanced components include console logging for debugging:

- Profile data refresh operations
- Upload responses
- Store update operations
- Profile picture URL changes

## Future Enhancements

- Add image cropping functionality
- Implement image compression for better performance
- Add support for multiple profile picture formats
- Implement profile picture fallback images
- Add profile picture validation (dimensions, aspect ratio)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Profile picture not updating in header**: Check browser console for Redux store update logs
2. **Profile picture not persisting**: Verify Redux persist configuration
3. **Upload failures**: Check backend endpoint accessibility and file size limits

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check backend endpoints
curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/users/profile/picture

# Check frontend store state (in browser console)
console.log(store.getState().auth.user)
```
